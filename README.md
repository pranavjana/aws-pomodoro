# Pomodoro Timer App

Welcome to my **Pomodoro Timer App**! This project is a modern, minimalist timer designed to help with productivity and focus. It's built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS to create a clean and engaging user interface. This app is part of my journey to improve my web development skills, specifically with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React framework.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Technique**: The timer follows the Pomodoro technique, helping users manage their work and break times.
- **Modern Design**: A minimalist interface that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use.
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: Built with React for dynamic functionality and Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: To create reusable components and manage the app's state efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For quick, consistent, and responsive styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To manage timer logic and interactivity.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the core structure and styling of the app.
